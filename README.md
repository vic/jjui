# Jujutsu UI

`jjui` is a terminal user interface for working with [Jujutsu version control system](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj). I have built it according to my own needs and will keep adding new features as I need them. I am open to feature requests and contributions.

## Features

Currently, you can:

### Change revset with auto-complete
You can change revset while enjoying auto-complete and signature help while typing.

### Rebase
You can rebase a revision or a branch onto another revision in the revision tree.

See [Rebase](https://github.com/idursun/jjui/wiki/Rebase) for detailed information.

### Squash
You can squash revisions into one revision, by pressing `S`. The following revision will be automatically selected. However, you can change the selection by using `j` and `k`.

### Show revision details

Pressing `l` (as in going right into details of a revision) will open the details view of the revision you selected.

In this mode, you can:
- Split selected files using `s`
- Restore selected files using `r`
- View diffs of the highlighted by pressing `d`

### Bookmarks
You can move bookmarks to the revision you selected.

### Preview
You can open the preview window by pressing `p`. Preview window displays output of the `jj show` command of the selected revision. If the currenlty selected item is a file, then `jj diff` output is displayed. 

While the preview window is showing, you can press; `ctrl+n` to scroll one line down, `ctrl+p` to scroll one line up, `ctrl+n` to scroll half page down, `ctrl+u` to scroll half page up. 

Additionally, you can press `tab` to focus in and out of the preview window. Once in the focus mode, you can use normal (e.g. `j`, `k`, `d`, `u`) navigation keys as they are not bound to the revision tree view. 

For detailed information, see [Preview](https://github.com/idursun/jjui/wiki/Preview) wiki page.
