# Jujutsu UI

`jjui` is a terminal user interface for working with [Jujutsu version control system](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj). I have built it according to my own needs and will keep adding new features as I need them. I am open to feature requests and contributions.

## Features

Currently, you can:

### Change revset with auto-complete
You can change revset while enjoying auto-complete and signature help while typing.

### Squash
You can squash revisions into one revision, by pressing `S`. The following revision will be automatically selected. However, you can change the selection by using `j` and `k`.

### Show revision details

Pressing `l` (as in going right into details of a revision) will open the details view of the revision you selected.

You can use `d` to show the diff of the each highlighted file.

#### Splitting files in a revision
You can use `s` to split the revision based on the files you have selected. You can select by pressing `space`. If no file is selected, currently highlighted file will be split.
